# Lab Report 5

**How I found the tests with different results**
I found the tests by running the time bash command for both markdown parsers. Then I manually compared the outputs from each until I found differences.
**Links to the test files with different results
- [test1](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/32.md)
- [test2](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/371.md)

**Test 1**


- For each test:
- Describe which implementation is correct or neither 
- screenshots of both outputs and the expected outputs:

This is a screenshot that shows that `[/f&ouml;&ouml; "f&ouml;&ouml;"]` should be the correct output according to commonmark.

This is a screenshot of the outputs for test 2.

- For each test:
- Describe which implementation is correct or neither 
- screenshots of both outputs and the expected outputs 

- for wrong implementation, describe bug in 2-3 sentences (what is wrong and code that should be fixed) (ss of code highlighting what should be fixed)
