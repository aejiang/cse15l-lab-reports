# Lab Report 5

- How I found the tests with different results
- Link to the test files with different results

- For each test:
- Describe which implementation is correct or neither 
- screenshots of both outputs and the expected outputs 
- for wrong implementation, describe bug in 2-3 sentences (what is wrong and code that should be fixed) (ss of code highlighting what should be fixed)
